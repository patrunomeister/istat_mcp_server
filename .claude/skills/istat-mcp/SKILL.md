  Workflow guide for querying Italian ISTAT statistical data via this MCP server.
  Use this skill whenever working with ISTAT data, SDMX dataflows, Italian statistics,
  regional/provincial data, unemployment, population, GDP, agriculture, or any other
  ISTAT indicator — even when the user doesn't explicitly mention ISTAT or SDMX.
  Triggers on requests like "trova dati ISTAT su X", "disoccupazione per regione",
  "dati popolazione Italia", "statistiche agricoltura", or any query that could be
  answered with official Italian statistical data.

# ISTAT MCP Server — Query Workflow

This MCP server exposes 9 tools to access Italian ISTAT statistical data via the SDMX REST API.
Always follow the **3-step workflow** below. Never skip steps.

---

## The 3-Step Workflow

### Step 1 — `discover_dataflows`

Search for relevant dataflows. The tool runs both **semantic search** and **keyword search**
and returns results as markdown with two sections.

Your job: read both sections and pick the most relevant dataflow ID for the user's request.
Prefer dataflows whose `name_it`/`name_en` directly match the topic. When in doubt, check
the top semantic results first, then look for keyword matches that might be more precise.

```
discover_dataflows(keywords="disoccupazione regioni", max_results=10)
```

Parameters:
- `keywords`: free text, Italian or English, can be a full question or a few words
- `max_results`: how many candidates from each source (default 10, max 100)

#### Fallback — when results are not relevant

If the top semantic results don't match the user's topic (e.g., names are about unrelated subjects),
**do not stop** — try `discover_dataflows` again with different keywords before concluding that
data doesn't exist. Strategies to try, in order:

1. **Synonyms or related terms** — e.g., if "olio oliva" fails, try "olive", "oleario", "grassi vegetali"
2. **Switch language** — if Italian keywords fail, try English (or vice versa)
3. **Broader category** — e.g., if "olio d'oliva" fails, try "agricoltura", "prodotti alimentari", "agroalimentare"
4. **Increase `max_results`** — try `max_results=50` to surface less obvious matches
5. **Different angle** — think about how ISTAT might classify the topic (e.g., by sector ATECO, by transport mode, by price index)

Only after 2–3 failed `discover_dataflows` attempts with diverse keywords should you conclude
that the data is not available in this MCP server and suggest alternative sources.

### Step 2 — `get_constraints`

**Always verify** the data is available with the desired cut before fetching.
Returns a **compact summary**: for each dimension, the codelist ID and the number of available values,
plus the time range. Full values are cached server-side.

```
get_constraints(dataflow_id="151_914_DF_DCCV_TAXDISOCCU1_7")
```

What to check:
- **REF_AREA**: is the value_count > 0? Do you need specific territory codes?
- **TIME_PERIOD**: does the series cover the period the user needs?
- **Dimension values**: for dimensions with few values (SEX, FREQ, AGE), use `search_constraint_values`
  to retrieve the actual codes.

If the desired cut is not available, go back to Step 1 and try a different dataflow.

### Step 2b — `search_constraint_values` (when you need actual codes)

After `get_constraints` populates the cache, use this to look up specific codes.
Supports optional substring search on code or description.

```
# Get all values for a dimension
search_constraint_values(dataflow_id="41_983_...", dimension="REF_AREA")

# Search by name (case-insensitive substring)
search_constraint_values(dataflow_id="41_983_...", dimension="REF_AREA", search="Palermo")
# → [{"code": "082053", "description_it": "Palermo", "description_en": "Palermo"}]

# Get all SEX codes
search_constraint_values(dataflow_id="151_914_...", dimension="SEX")
# → [{"code": "1", ...maschi}, {"code": "2", ...femmine}, {"code": "9", ...totale}]
```

Use this instead of reading the full constraints output when a dimension has many values (e.g., REF_AREA
with all municipalities). For small dimensions (SEX, FREQ, AGE) you can also read them directly.

**Important limitation:** `search_constraint_values` returns codes available **across the entire dataflow**,
not for a specific combination of other dimensions. A code may appear in the list but return no data
when combined with certain values of other dimensions (e.g., `TP_THOQUIN_EXT` exists for some crops
but not for olive oil `PRESIL`). If `get_data` returns no records despite a seemingly valid filter,
explore which codes actually have data for your specific combination using curl with `lastNObservations=1`:

```bash
# Omit the uncertain dimension (e.g., DATA_TYPE) to discover which values have data
curl -kL -H "Accept: application/vnd.sdmx.data+csv;version=1.0.0" \
  "https://esploradati.istat.it/SDMXWS/rest/data/{dataflow_id}/{FREQ}.{REF_AREA}..{TYPE_OF_CROP}.{DEST}?lastNObservations=1"
# The response shows which DATA_TYPE codes actually exist for that specific combination
```

This is the fastest way to discover valid code combinations without downloading the full dataset.

### Step 3 — `get_data`

Fetch actual data, applying the filters you identified in Step 2.

```
get_data(
  id_dataflow="151_914_DF_DCCV_TAXDISOCCU1_7",
  dimension_filters={
    "REF_AREA": ["ITC1", "ITC4", "ITD3"],   # codes from get_constraints
    "SEX": ["9"],                             # 9 = totale
    "FREQ": ["A"],                            # A = annual
    "DURATION_UNEMPLOYMENT": ["TOTAL"]
  },
  start_period="2020-01-01",
  end_period="2024-12-31"
)
```

Notes:
- `dimension_filters` is a dict mapping dimension IDs → list of code strings
- Omit a dimension to get all its values — **this can produce enormous responses and cause timeouts**
- `start_period` / `end_period` filter the time series

---

## Avoiding Timeouts — Always Filter

The ISTAT API times out (180s) on broad, unfiltered requests. The payload grows multiplicatively
with every dimension you leave open: 20 regions × 3 sexes × 5 age groups × 200 citizenships × 10 years
= millions of cells. Always apply filters.

**Safe defaults when the user hasn't specified a breakdown:**

| Dimension | Safe default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `REF_AREA` | `["IT"]` | Italy total (not regional breakdown) |
| `SEX` | `["9"]` | Both sexes combined |
| `FREQ` | `["A"]` | Annual (not monthly/quarterly) |

Start narrow, then expand if the user asks for more granularity. A fast partial answer
is always better than a timeout.

**Example — generic question → safe first call:**
```
# User asks: "quanti stranieri in Italia per paese di provenienza?"
# Wrong: get_data(id_dataflow="29_317_...", dimension_filters={})  ← TIMEOUT
# Right:
get_data(
  id_dataflow="29_317_DF_DCIS_POPSTRCIT1_1",
  dimension_filters={"REF_AREA": ["IT"], "SEX": ["9"], "FREQ": ["A"]},
  start_period="2022-01-01",
  end_period="2023-12-31"
)
```

---

## Large Responses

`get_data` returns a TSV. When the result set is large, the server truncates the output
and includes a note with the total row count. If truncation occurs:
- The data returned is still valid — just the first N rows
- Ask the user if they want a narrower filter to get the complete dataset
- The full data is cached server-side and can be re-fetched with tighter filters

---

## Territorial Codes — `get_territorial_codes`

Use this **before Step 3** when the user asks for data by territory and you need REF_AREA codes.

```
# All codes for a level
get_territorial_codes(level="regione")       # 21 regions → ITC1, ITC2, ...
get_territorial_codes(level="provincia")     # all provinces
get_territorial_codes(level="comune")        # all municipalities
get_territorial_codes(level="ripartizione")  # Nord-Ovest, Nord-Est, Centro, Sud, Isole
get_territorial_codes(level="italia")        # national level → IT

# Search by name (substring, case-insensitive)
get_territorial_codes(name="Lombardia")   # → ITC4
get_territorial_codes(name="Torino")      # → search across all levels
```

Cross-reference the returned codes with what `get_constraints` shows under `REF_AREA`
to confirm the territory is available in that specific dataflow.

## Supporting Tools

Use these when you need more detail beyond Step 2.

| Tool | When to use |
|---|---|
| `search_constraint_values(dataflow_id, dimension, search)` | Look up codes for a specific dimension (with optional name filter) |
| `get_structure(id_datastructure)` | Get the full list of dimensions for a dataflow's data structure |
| `get_codelist_description(codelist_id)` | Get human-readable descriptions for all codes in a codelist |
| `get_concepts` | Explore concept schemes (rare — only needed for deep metadata) |
| `get_cache_diagnostics` | Debug cache state (not needed for normal queries) |

The `codelist` values come from `get_constraints` output (field `codelist` on each dimension summary).

---

## Rate Limiting

**Never make more than one ISTAT API call every 12 seconds.**

The server has a built-in rate limiter that enforces this pause automatically — if you call
two tools back-to-back, the second one will block until 12 seconds have elapsed since the first.
This is expected behavior, not an error. A typical 3-step workflow (discover → constraints → data)
takes at least 24 seconds of enforced wait time.

Do not retry a call that appears to be hanging — it is likely queued behind the rate limiter.

## Common Patterns

### Regional data for all Italy
```
1. discover_dataflows(keywords="tasso disoccupazione regionale")
2. get_constraints(dataflow_id="...")      # confirm REF_AREA has ITC1–ITG2
3. get_territorial_codes(level="regione") # get all 21 region codes
4. get_data(id_dataflow="...", dimension_filters={
     "REF_AREA": ["ITC1","ITC2","ITC3","ITC4","ITD1","ITD2","ITD3","ITD4","ITD5",
                  "ITE1","ITE2","ITE3","ITE4","ITF1","ITF2","ITF3","ITF4","ITF5","ITF6",
                  "ITG1","ITG2"],
     "SEX": ["9"], "FREQ": ["A"]
   })
```

### Filter by sex and age
```
# From get_constraints you know: SEX: 1=maschi, 2=femmine, 9=totale
#                                 AGE: Y15-74, Y15-64, Y20-64
get_data(..., dimension_filters={"SEX": ["2"], "AGE": ["Y15-74"]})
```

### Annual vs quarterly data
```
# FREQ: A=annuale, Q=trimestrale, M=mensile
get_data(..., dimension_filters={"FREQ": ["A"]}, start_period="2015-01-01")
```

### Specific province or city
```
get_territorial_codes(name="Torino")     # fast lookup via local parquet (no API call)
get_constraints(dataflow_id="...")       # confirm REF_AREA has value_count > 0
# If get_territorial_codes didn't find the code (non-territorial dimension), use:
search_constraint_values(dataflow_id="...", dimension="REF_AREA", search="Torino")
get_data(..., dimension_filters={"REF_AREA": ["<code>"]})
```
